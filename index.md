### Brief Project Description:
831 participants from PNC were included. CBF (from ASL) and ALFF (from rs-FMRI) images were projected to the 2D surface space (fsaverage5), and vertexwise coupling occured via locally-weighted regressions. Group level regressions relating coupling to age, sex, and executive functioning accuracy were performed.

# CODE DOCUMENTATION

**The analytic workflow implemented in this project is described in detail in the following sections. Analysis steps are described in the order they were implemented; the script(s) used for each step are identified and links to the code on github are provided.** 
<br>

### Sample Construction

We first constructed our sample from the PNC 1,601 imaging dataset. Each participant underwent cognitive testing, clinical phenotyping, and neuroimaging.

Script: *n831_alff_cbf_makeSample.R* takes the PNC 1601 sample, and goes through a variety of exclusions to get the final n. Specifically, it removes subjects with poor QA data, medical comorbidity, abnormal brain structure, or on psychoactive medications.
  
### CBF-ALFF Map generation

After we obtained our sample, we constructed single subject CBF-ALFF coupling maps. 

Two previously available wikis discuss the steps required to generate single subject coupling maps.

- Volume to surface projection : https://github.com/PennBBL/tutorials/wiki/3D-Volume-to-Surface-Projection-(FS)
  
Script: *vol2surf.sh* converts the transform matrix (lta_convert), projects the volume to the surface (mri_vol2surf), and resamples the surface to fsaverage5 space (mri_surf2surf). 
      
- how to generate 2D coupling maps : https://github.com/PennBBL/tutorials/wiki/Surface-Coupling
   
Script: *coupling_v2.R* (calls kth_neighbors_v3.R) estimates coupling for a given list of subjects. Flag options for the coupling job are listed at the top of this script.
    
Script: *kth_neighbors_v3.R* is run by coupling_v2.R and estimates the first k sets of nearest neighbors for each vertex for a particular template.
   
### Coupling Regressions

We next wanted to examine whether CBF-ALFF coupling changed across development, differed by sex, and related to executive functioning. 

*script: coupling_accuracy_fx_T_with_effect_sizes.R*

  - This script goes vertex by vertex and does coupling regressions, specifically relating CBF-ALFF coupling to age, sex, and cognition. It does vertex-level FDR correction, thresholds at SNR>=50 and stores both corrected and uncorrected Ts, ps, and effect sizes into vectors and saves them to the output. These files can then be used for visualization in matlab. 

*script: scatter_plots.R*

  - In addition to doing vertex-level analysis, we also explored how mean coupling (i.e. 1 value per participant) related to age. We used the FDR-corrected output from the coupling_accuracy_fx_T_with_effect_sizes.R age analysis as inputs. We also calculated the derivative of the spline to assess where the couplingxage effects were most rapidly changing.

### Visualizations on inflated brain

*script: PBP_vertWiseEffect_Erica_Ts_pos_and_neg_results_outpath.m*

  - This is a sample of one of the matlab visualization scripts. It is called with three parameters, and produces an inflated brain. 

  - For example, a call would be: PBP_vertWiseEffect_Erica_Ts_pos_and_neg_results_outpath('/project/imco/baller/results/CR_revision/couplingxsnr_maps/eaxmask_50_lh.csv','/project/imco/baller/results/CR_revision/couplingxsnr_maps/eaxmask_50_rh.csv','eaxmask_thresh50_values')

### Spin Testing and Visualization

In reviewing our results, we became interested in whether our findings mapped onto Yeo 7 networks. For interpretability and for graphs, we decided to do a variation on the spin test. Overall, the goal was to take the vertices (10242 for each hemisphere), and spin. We would next ask how many vertices would randomly and by chance fall within certain Yeo networks as compared to what we actually saw. A challenge of this spin is that when we spin the vertices, we include medial wall which is guaranteed to be 0. In order to account for this, we calculated the proportion of vertices within each network minus the ones in the medial wall.

*script: make_trinarized_maps_for_spin_test_snr.R*

  - This script makes trinarized yeo masks, 1, 0, -1. In order to run permutation analyses on the Yeo networks, I need to trinarize my fdr corrected maps. If a vertex is corrected, it will get a 1. If not, 0. If it is within the medial wall, it will get a -1. This will allow me to later assess how many vertices within each network met correction (1s), did not meet statistical significance (0s), and should be excluded from the proportion calculation (-1). For the mean CBF-ALFF map, as no statistic was calculated, we retain the T values and spin them directly. 

*script: SpinPermuFS.m*

  - This matlab script makes the spins. We provided 5 parameters
    1. left hemisphere vector with trinarized data
    2. Right hemisphere vector with trinarized data
    3. Number of permutations per hemisphere (we use 1000/hemisphere)
    4. output directory
    5. output filename
  
*script: spin_proportion_calculations_and_plots_snr.R*

  - This script calculates the proportion of FDR-corrected vertices within each Yeo 7 network for both the real data as well as the 2000 permuted spins. The proportion was calculated by taking the (# of vertices with a 1) divided(/) by the (number of total vertices within network minus number of negative vertices). For the mean coupling results, we evaluated the spun T values with the actual T values per network.

*script: violin_plots.R*

  - Lastly, this visualization script uses ggplot2 to make violin plots for display, calling functions from imco_functions.R. The violin represents the distribution of proportions from the permutation analysis. The black bar represents the real data.
